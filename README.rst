**WebKit-based status line for tiling window managers.**

wkline is a statusline plugin that launches a plain GTK window with a WebKit WebView
pointing to a static HTML file containing the statusline. It provides a smooth
looking statusline with CSS transitions and effects and the possibility of having a
blurred background without a desktop compositor running.

are being ported to C).
